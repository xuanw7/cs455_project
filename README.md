# CS 445 Final Project

## Project Description
#### For our final project, our group created a 3D rendering game/cartoon using Pygame and the principles of projection, rotation, and perspective matrices. The rendering results include a cube or other 3D shape that rotates, changes colors based on its position, reflects lighting, and can morph into different shapes. Additionally, the user is able to change the position and angle of the camera as the cube rotates using the keyboard. 

## Installing Pygame
#### In order to run our project, it is required to have Pygame installed: https://www.pygame.org/news
```pip install pygame```

## How to Run the Project
1. Download code off of GitHub or extract files from zipped folder
2. Open code in a code editor, such as Visual Studio Code. All of the project is in our main.py file.
3. Press the Run button. A separate window should open up with the visualization showing.
4. Use the a, w, s, d keys to control the camera position 

## How to Adjust the 3D Shape
#### The default shape for our rendering is a cube, but the user is able to adjust the shape they want based on the values in the array cube_vertices (lines 15-16 in our code), that are the normalized positions of the vertices of the shape in the 3D space.
